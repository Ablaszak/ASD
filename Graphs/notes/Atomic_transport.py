The problem:
We have two vertexes, u and v
We want to transport two atomic fucking bombs xD (one from v to u and the other from u to v)
Every bomb van go one or zero edges per round and can't be closer than D (closer means shortest path between them)
We want to find two paths (no matter how long) they can go through
